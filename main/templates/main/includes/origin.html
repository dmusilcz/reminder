  <p>He wanted something to remind him about the expiration dates in advance in order to react in time, so he made this app.</p>
  <p>He thought other people could benefit from this as well, so here it is if you want it.</p>
  <p>If you'd like to contact the guy, please use this <a href="{{ contact_url }}" class="link-blue">contact form</a>.</p>{% endblocktrans %}
